1. **Q**: What is a namespace?
  
    **A**: A namespace is a way to create clean, organizaed code. Essentially, they contain other code elements (ie-- interface, classes, etc). No two namespaces can have the same variable names, etc, thus creating seperate, organized code. 
  
2. **Q**: What are value types?

   **A**: Value types are elements of code that contain data, and can be "assigned a value directly." Int, char, and float are all examples of different value types. 
 
3. **Q**: What are reference types?

   **A**: While a value type contains data directly, a reference type contains-- as the name implies-- references to data/objects. It "stores the adress" where the actual value/data is stored. Thus, it acts as a signal to the location of the actual data. Elements like class, arrays, and strings are reference types. 
   
4. **Q**: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?

   **A**: An automatic property is a way of making code cleaner/simpler/less tedious. The compiler automatically creates a private field, and a get/set method along with it. 
   
5. **Q**: What is the purpose of using statement?

   **A**: The purpose of a using statement is to "specify the scope of a resource object." Essentially, they are useful because they cut down on the amount of code/calls in a block of code, leading to simpler, cleaner syntax. 
   
6. **Q**: What are dynamic type variables?

   **A**: As the name suggests, dynamic type vaiables are more "dynamic" or flexible, and can store any type of value. In addition, "type checking" for dynamic types occurs at run-time, thus seperating them from object type variable.s 
   
7. **Q**: What is the purpose of the is operator?
  
   **A**: The "is" operator is used to ensure an operator matches with a given type. 
   
8. **Q**: What are generics and how is using them useful?

   **A**: Generics allows you to create "data structures" without commiting one data type until later. It helps create better, "higher performing" code.
   
9. **Q**: What is the scope of a public member of a class?

   **A**: The scope of a public element is broad-- it can be used in the entire class/project/code. 
   
10. **Q**: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

     **A**: Yes, you can create a function that accepts a varying number of arguments. 
   
11. **Q**: How do you sort an array?

    **A**: There are actually a variety of ways to sort arrays, depending on the code and preference of the programmer/developer. Perhaps the most common ways is the Array.Sort method. 
   
12. **Q**: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?

    **A**: A nullable type is any type that allows for a "null" value/no value. It allows for representing yet undefinded values. 
   
13. **Q**: What is an enumeration?

    **A**: An enumeration simply referes to a list of named, integer constants. They are set. 
 
14. **Q**: What is inheritance?

    **A**: Inhertiance is a way of creating more useful, efficient, and effective code. It allows for a class to passes along variables, etc to another class. 
     
15. **Q**: Is multiple inheritance supported?

    **A**: No, multiple inheritance isn't supported. However, this is where the concept of interfaces can be useful, and can be used instead of multiple inheritance.
 
16. **Q**: What is the purpose of as operator

    **A**: The "as" operator allows for conversions between compatable (ie- nullable) types.
    
17. **Q**: What is an object?

    **A**: An object is an element of code that acts in accordance to a structure laid out by a class. A program will typically have several objects working together/interacting to create the output. 
     
18. **Q**: What is the difference between a struct and a class?

    **A**: Structs are value types, while classes are reference types. As the name suggests, structs are used for strucute, but can not inherit.
     
19. **Q**: What is the difference between continue and break statements?

    **A**: A break statement completely ends, or "breaks," the loob, and moves on to the next part of the code/program. However, a continue statement, while somewhat similar to a break statement, skip the remainder of the code and then go on to the next cycle of the loop. 
     
20. **Q**: What is this and how is it used?

    **A**: "This" calls upon the current instance of the class you are currently in. 
     
21. **Q**: What is try and catch and when are they used?

    **A**: Try and catch are methods of exception handling. The try block identifies code that activates the exception, and is followed by at least one catch. The catch block highlights where the exception is caught.
     
22. **Q**: How is exception handling done?

    **A**: Exception handling is done by four blacks: try, catch, finally, and throw. Exception handling is a response to any problems that would occur when the code is executed. 
     
23. **Q**: What is finally and what is its purpose?

    **A**: Regardless of whether an exception is thrown, a finally block executes the statement. 
    
24. **Q**: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.

    **A**: An array is set, while and arraylist does not have a set size. Therefore, when you know the size of your data, is is better to us an array since it is more efficient. However, since the data size is not known often, an arraylist allows for more flexibility.
     
25. **Q**: What is an object?

    **A**: See question 17.
     
26. **Q**: Define constructor.

    **A**: A constructer has the same name as a class and no return type. It's "executed" whenever creating new objects in a class. 
     
27. **Q**: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?

    **A**: Var is an implicit variable type, but it can be just as strong as a variable type that is declared. The variable type is determined at compile time. This may be useful if you have several variable types, as it is one less step for you to think of. 
     
28. **Q**: What is an abstract class?

    **A**: An abstract class 
    
29. **Q**: What is an interface?

    **A**:
    
30. **Q**: What is a method?
    
    **A**:
     
31. **Q**: What is a property?

     **A**:
32. **Q**: What is an access specifier?

     **A**:
     
33. **Q**: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?

     **A**:
     
34. **Q**: What is a collection?

     **A**:
   
35. **Q**: What is a Hash Table?

     **A**:
